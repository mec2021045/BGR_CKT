# Band Gap Referance Circuit
## Abstract 
### A temperature independent voltage reference circuit that is widely used in integrated circuits is known as a bandgap voltage reference. It generates a fixed (constant) voltage regardless of power supply variations, temperature changes, or device circuit loading.
 I have developed band referance circuit that can produce a constant voltage of 1.2 voltage in between tem range of -10 to 120 with tem coeffiecient of 11 ppm/degree_centigrade 
## Implimentation 
 To  generate constant voltage ,we need t use combination of CTAT and PTAT cicuits that can be generated developed using resistor and diode
 I have used ** cadence virtuoso ** I have used to design CTAT and PTAT circuit using BJT ,NMOS,PMOS,Resistors.
 ### Generation of CTAT 
 If constant voltage is passed through diode then votage across diode is decresing with absolute temperature. This property oof diode is used to develop CTAT Circuit. Generally To replicate to property of diode ,we use PNP Transistor whose base and collector are shorted together which acts as simple diode.
 ### Generation of PTAT 
 N number of diode are connected in parralel to generate a PTAT voltage (assuming same current flow through both the nodes).
 
 To make currents equal in both nodes ,we need to use intermidiary circuit,that can make currents in both nodes equal. This can be done in two ways 
 1. Using currents mirror
 2. Using OP-Amp
 I ahev used current mirror methpd to generate equal current.

## Analysis
The Value of alpha=R2/R1 is calculated through theoratical calculation and is updated in schematic 
W/L Valus is taken constant  intially
I have performed DC analysis with temperature ranging from 10 to 120 degree celcius,as my swip variable and the result are plotted .
## Result
I have plotted the intial CTAT, PTAT,Vref by using theoretical value of R1 and R2,but i didnt get Vref ,so i tweaked the values of R1 nad R2 to get exact graph of Verf which becomes constant and 1.2 volt for the considerd temperature range.
### The final results with tweak R1 and R2 values is shown here.

The Temperature coeffiecient is Verf is calculted from maximum and minimu voltgae generated by Vref Curve and found out be 11 ppm/degree celcuis .
The graph Vref for calculation of tem coefficient is as shown below
